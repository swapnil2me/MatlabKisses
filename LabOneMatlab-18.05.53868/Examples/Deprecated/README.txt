Zurich Instruments LabOne Matlab API Deprecated Examples.

The examples in this package are marked as deprecated since they use
Modules that will at some point be discontinued: The SW Trigger Module
(instatiated via ziDAQ's 'record' command) and Spectrum Module
(instantiated via ziDAQ's 'zoomFFT' command). These modules have been
superseded by the Data Acquisition Module; please refer to the
examples in the Common folder that use the Data Acquisition Module
(instantiated via ziDAQ's dataAcquisitionModule command) class.
